I developed a form phrases game as a web app. The challenge is to guess the action that would reduce your carbon footprint using words from a pool of options. Additional clues in the form of category and the amount of carbon emissions per year saved is revealed as well. One can develop their understanding about how to reduce their carbon footprint. When the player correctly guesses the phrase, they will see the time taken and the number of tries needed. This is supported on both desktop and handheld devices. 

Try this game on either desktop or a handheld device.
